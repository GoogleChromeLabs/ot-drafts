# For Interfaces, Events, or Members of Either

Thank you for helping document the web platform. 

## A Note about Code Examples

Code examples are not applications. Many practices of application building are not appropriate for code examples. Since the code example you create will eventually be on MDN, we use [their guidelines](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FMDN%2FGuidelines%2FCode_guidelines&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFwTJp-gpK_R61jaxcHnsjQC9vx7g). Please read them, especially if you have never done code examples for documentation.

# Origin Trial Drafts

[TBD]

## I'm Preparing for a Developer Trial or Origin Trial

The documentation produced in this stage will be minimal, focusing on accuracy and prioritizing a code example over document depth. Follow the instructions behind the appropriate link below. 

* [I am implementing one or more interfaces or events](./api-instructions.md).

* [I am adding an interface member such as an event callback, a method, or a property](./api-instructions.md).

## I'm Preparing to Ship a Feature

Do this procedure while you are preparing your feature for beta.

1. If you did not create MVP documentation during an earlier stage, do so now by following the procedure above, but do not add them to your spec repo. 
2. Notify Chrome Developer Relations that you are shipping your feature in an upcoming release of Chrome. We will work with you to publish a fuller documentation set on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference).
3. Remove the MVP documentation from your spec repo. Duplicate documentation is hard to keep in sync and hence, and antipattern.
4. Your responsibilities are officially complete (though we wouldn't complain if you helped us keep an eye on MDN).
